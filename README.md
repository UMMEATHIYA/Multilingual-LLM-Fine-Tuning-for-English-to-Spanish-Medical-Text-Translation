# Multilingual LLM Fine-Tuning for English-to-Spanish Medical Text Translation

This project demonstrates fine-tuning a **multilingual language model** (LLM) for **English-to-Spanish medical text translation**. The model uses **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** to improve alignment with user intent and provide high-quality translations in the medical domain.

## Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune a **MarianMT** model (Helsinki-NLP) on a dataset of medical English-Spanish text pairs. The fine-tuning process leverages **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**, allowing the model to adjust and align better with the desired output based on human feedback.

### Key Features
- **Fine-tuning MarianMT** for English-Spanish medical text translation.
- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** to improve translation accuracy and user alignment.
- The system can be used to handle sensitive and domain-specific language translation in the medical field.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` for package management

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas
```

Project Structure
preprocess.py: Data preprocessing script that loads and tokenizes the English-Spanish medical text dataset.
fine_tune.py: Script for fine-tuning the MarianMT model using the preprocessed dataset.
rlhf.py: Implements the RLHF update rule to fine-tune the model based on human feedback.
full_training.py: Combines fine-tuning and RLHF steps in one script.
medical_text.csv: Sample dataset containing English-Spanish medical text pairs (you need to provide this dataset).
Usage
Step 1: Preprocess Data
The preprocess.py script is used to load and preprocess the English-Spanish medical dataset.

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py
This will load your CSV file with columns English and Spanish, tokenize the sentences, and return preprocessed data.

Step 2: Fine-Tune the Model
Once the data is preprocessed, use fine_tune.py to fine-tune the MarianMT model. This script fine-tunes the model on the medical text pairs.

bash
Copy
Edit
python fine_tune.py
Step 3: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
The RLHF part is implemented in rlhf.py. This script adjusts the model's weights based on human feedback. Simulated human feedback (e.g., a score from 0 to 1) is used for training.

bash
Copy
Edit
python rlhf.py
Step 4: Full Training Loop
Combine both fine-tuning and RLHF by running the full_training.py script, which will run the entire process from training the model to updating it with RLHF.

bash
Copy
Edit
python full_training.py
Example Code for RLHF
python
Copy
Edit
from rlhf import rlhf_update
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer
from torch.optim import Adam

# Load MarianMT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained('Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es')
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained('Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es')
optimizer = Adam(model.parameters(), lr=5e-6)

# Example: Simulate human feedback for a translation
english_text = "The patient needs urgent attention."
spanish_text = "El paciente necesita atención urgente."
feedback = 0.9  # Human feedback score (from 0 to 1)

# Perform RLHF update
loss = rlhf_update(model, english_text, spanish_text, feedback, optimizer)
print(f"RLHF loss: {loss}")
Model Training Flow
Preprocessing: The script tokenizes the English-Spanish dataset for MarianMT model training.
Fine-Tuning: The fine-tuning step adjusts the MarianMT model using the preprocessed dataset.
RLHF: Human feedback is simulated to guide the model’s learning. The feedback score helps update the model during training.
## Results
After fine-tuning the model, the translation accuracy can be evaluated on the validation set.
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) improves the model's alignment with user intent by providing feedback on translation quality.
The final model achieves better alignment for medical text translation with human-like judgment.
